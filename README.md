## Calibration
The calibration process ensures that the magnet glove sensors accurately detect hand gestures. Follow these steps for calibration:
1. **Initial Position**: Place your hand in a neutral position.
2. **Follow Prompts**: Move your hand according to the on-screen prompts to calibrate each sensor.
3. **Complete Calibration**: Once all gestures are calibrated, the game will notify you that the calibration is complete.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- Endless Running: The character runs automatically, and the player's goal is to avoid obstacles for as long as possible.
- Obstacle Types:
-   Fireballs: Use the gun gesture to destroy fireballs.
-   Ice: Use the call gesture to destroy ice blocks.
-   Cacti: Use the victory gesture to jump over cacti.

## Development
This project was developed using Unity and C#. The hardware integration involves interfacing the magnet glove with the game via custom scripts that process the sensor data and translate it into game controls.
